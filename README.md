# Landing_Page

HTML + CSS (flexbox) simple landing page excercise

I used only vanilla HTML and CSS using this project.
It was a good lesson about flexbox control, and overall reacreating a visual of a usable site.

I tried to swith up the usual Tesla website white colorway with a deep blue-black one.
